Maxim,
that's great!

&gt;<i> I managed to get some data out but think it comes out fragmented
</I>&gt;<i> depending on how I do things... If I tell the station to start
</I>&gt;<i> transferring before I press OK in the 'Total Open Station download'
</I>&gt;<i> menu I get large part of the file be the beginning seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> missing; if I press OK and only then tell the station to start the
</I>&gt;<i> transfer I get I small set of data and then it stops; If I press again
</I>&gt;<i> after that in both cases more data gets transferred.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried this with the GSI format and a few other formats (one of them
</I>&gt;<i> was simply called 'relatorio' in portuguese, report in english, dunno
</I>&gt;<i> if it is something a bit more simple).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any advice on how to correctly transfer all the data?
</I>
This might be something wrong with our defaults for how much we wait
between one ``read()`` and the following &#8210; e.g. see
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/27a645a3158d/scripts/totalopenstation-gui.py#cl-706">https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/27a645a3158d/scripts/totalopenstation-gui.py#cl-706</A>

You might try changing the ``sleep()`` time to a smaller amount of
seconds &#8210; if you have no idea of how to do it we can explain in more
detail.

&gt;<i> Secondly I tried out the 'process data' option (although didn't really
</I>&gt;<i> expect much of a result since the model I use is not listed) and
</I>&gt;<i> selected the older TCR model in the list, but the result only has some
</I>&gt;<i> headers and no data.. I read a little bit about the GSI format on this
</I>&gt;<i> page
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.intrasis.com/web_help_english/Admin/adminFilesGSI.htm">http://www.intrasis.com/web_help_english/Admin/adminFilesGSI.htm</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be manageable, I'm guessing it is something you've come
</I>&gt;<i> across before.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is it really that the 'process data option' does? Is it simple to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a new model for the 'process data' option..? I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> help in anyway I can with this..!
</I>
We would be happy if you could contribute to the development of TOPS
with a new input format! The basic functionality of &quot;process data&quot; is
very simple: it reads the original data and performs some filters until
we get a standard representation of each data point.

You can take a look at
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/27a645a3158d/totalopenstation/formats/leica_tcr_705.py">https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/27a645a3158d/totalopenstation/formats/leica_tcr_705.py</A>
and the respective sample data in
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/27a645a3158d/sample_data/leica_tcr_705">https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/27a645a3158d/sample_data/leica_tcr_705</A> to have an idea.

In fact, I have a bunch of GSI files on my hard disk, but I've never had
the time to look at them: it should not be difficult to write an &quot;input
parser&quot; for it.

I won't be able to read my e-mail very often in the following weeks, but
I'll do my best.

Ciao
steko
