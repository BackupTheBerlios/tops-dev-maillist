<PRE>Hi,
this is our new development mailing list at berlios.de. The old one was
almost empty anyway.

I've been working a bit on Total Open Station recently, partly fixing
old code and partly working on new features.

I guess some of the fixes can go into a true 0.1 release (given the fact
that we haven't uploaded any archives online yet), or we could just ship
0.1 as we intended to do and release this updated version as 0.2.

This way the next 0.3 version would be out next release goal, featuring:
      * GTK + GUI (already working on it)
      * easy_install-able package
      * Debian package
      * more models &amp; formats
      * separation between &quot;model&quot; and &quot;input format&quot; (I've discovered
        that my Zeiss has 4 different formats!)

Please keep in mind these are all *random* ideas at all, I've mostly
worked bottom-up with no planning until now (although I had some ideas
in mind).

I've put online also the slides used in Vienna and Pontedera, please
find them at <A HREF="http://tops.berlios.de/slides/">http://tops.berlios.de/slides/</A>

I've realized one big problem with the current code structure is that
it's still meant for being executed in place from the source tree,
rather than installed in a standard way. This could give some problems
as we go on with development so we should find out a standard way for
structuring our source tree. Unfortunately, it's not very easy to find
documentation about this.

Please forgive the long e-mail.

Cheers,
Steko
