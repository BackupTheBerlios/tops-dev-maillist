<PRE>Hi!

Recently I've added support for translation to all user interfaces of
Total Open Station, using the good gettext module in the Python standard
library (see
<A HREF="http://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/changeset/e20e44e2b9ea/">http://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/changeset/e20e44e2b9ea/</A> for
the changeset that added gettext capabilities).

However, I really can't translate the program messages to nothing but
Italian. Thus, I've registered Total Open Station at transifex.net
<A HREF="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/totalopenstation/">https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/totalopenstation/</A> so everyone can
contribute by translating to her/his own language.

Translation is done in a few steps:
      * go to the &quot;component&quot; page at
        <A HREF="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/totalopenstation/c/totalopenstation-bitbucket/">https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/totalopenstation/c/totalopenstation-bitbucket/</A>
      * if you are registered, you can request to be added to the
        translation team and edit the translation file straight on the
        website

otherwise, if you don't want to sign-up to yet another website:

      * download the &quot;source file&quot;
        <A HREF="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/totalopenstation/c/totalopenstation-bitbucket/raw/po/totalopenstation.pot">https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/totalopenstation/c/totalopenstation-bitbucket/raw/po/totalopenstation.pot</A>
      * edit the source file on your computer using programs like
        poedit, KBabel (or anything you like best)
      * send it to this mailing list with the proper filename (e.g.
        Spanish would be es.po, Turkish tr.po and so on)
      * that's all!

We will include your translation in the source repository and give you
credit for your work. The next version of Total Open Station will
include your translation right away.

====================
 Total Open Station
====================

Total Open Station (TOPS for friends) is a free software program for
downloading and processing data from total station devices, written in
the Python programming language.

This is a task which is usually done by proprietary, dedicated and
Windows&#8482;-only software, but TOPS is different by nature, because:

- it is *free software* released under the GNU GPLv3 license;
- it works on *any* operating system, including mobile platforms like
  OpenMoko;
- it is designed to support as many devices and formats as possible, all
  within the same program, opposed to having one program per device.

Every model has its own quirks, but TOPS uses a modular structure and
keeps the downloading of data logically separated from its processing,
thus enabling exporting data to a variety of output formats, even at a
later moment. Archiving of raw data is made easy by using plain text
files.
