<PRE>Hi Stefano,

Thank you for your email!

I'll test the Windows installation again when I'm next in the office and
also have a total station handy. At home or in Egypt I use Ubuntu and TOPS
works totally fine. I just wanted to install it on Windows, as that's the
OS most OA users have... I also usually record points with the total
station rather than line strings, but I know loads of people do record
lines, and it is important to them that they can just export the line
strings rather than having to connect the points afterwards.

Concerning the geojson package - in what format would I send the data from
the total station? Would it be gsi?

Many thanks and all the best,

Anna

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Anna,
</I>&gt;<i> first of all big, big apologies for not getting back to your request
</I>&gt;<i> last month (or was it even September?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just yesterday I translated to English a step-by-step guide that covers
</I>&gt;<i> the installation of TOPS on Windows. You can find it at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/wiki/InstallingOnWindows">https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/wiki/InstallingOnWindows</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and I have tested it on 3 Windows XP machines (including a tablet PC).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other installation procedures might not be correct. Especially, pySerial
</I>&gt;<i> 2.5 (that is, the latest version that you get by default when
</I>&gt;<i> downloading) has a bug on Windows and it doesn't work properly. This has
</I>&gt;<i> been the cause of many headaches until I realised that 2.4 works like a
</I>&gt;<i> charm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before going into detailed debugging of the problem you're facing, I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to ask you to start over with that procedure (possibly
</I>&gt;<i> including installing a newer Python interpreter - you will find links
</I>&gt;<i> for that too in the guide).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would be grateful if someone could send me some sample data that can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be imported into TOPS, by the way, preferably some survey daya with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lines and / or polygons - I would like to export a dxf from TOPS and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see if the line data comes through.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stefano, you mentioned a possibility of exporting data from TOPS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without having to use the DXF2SHP converter in Qgis - I would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested to know what is done instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can get some sample data here
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/9609c1e38c14/sample_data-">https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/src/9609c1e38c14/sample_data-</A> I have some more data from Nikon and Leica devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The total station I'm working with has no support for lines and/or
</I>&gt;<i> polygons, just bare points, so I've never looked into creating them from
</I>&gt;<i> the raw data. But it's definitely possible to enhance the TOPS parser to
</I>&gt;<i> take it into account.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exporting data from TOPS straight into QGIS is possible if you install
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;geojson&quot; Python package <A HREF="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson/">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geojson/</A> (no
</I>&gt;<i> Windows installer though, I'm afraid). Then, a new output format becomes
</I>&gt;<i> available and it's OGR-compatible: QGIS can open GeoJSON data saved into
</I>&gt;<i> a plain text file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ciao,
</I>&gt;<i> Stefano
</I>&gt;<i>
