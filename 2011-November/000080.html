<PRE>Hi guys,

I installed TOPS on my Windows XP 32bit work machine yesterday and came
across a few issues, mainly serial port-related by the looks:

When I connected the total station (Leica TCR 805, works fine with TCR 705
parser with TOPS on Linux) to the serial port on my desktop I first checked
the connections manager in Leica GeoOffice (LGO). This told me that COM1
was my port and the data transfer via LGO worked fine.
So I selected the Leica TCR 705 parser in TOPS and put COM1 as my port and
hit &quot;connect&quot;. TOPS popped open a window saying I wasn't allowed to connect
to COM1 (Sorry, I forgot to take a note of the exact error), but here is
what it said in the commandline every time I tried:File
&quot;C:\Python25\lib\site-packages\totalopenstation
line 8
from . import *
SyntaxError: 'import *' not allowed with 'from [COM1].' (sorry, I didn't
manage to capture everything)I changed the settings to &quot;custom&quot; and changed
the baudrate to 19200, and still wasn't able to connect.
I was definitely using the same settings on the PC, in LGO, in TOPS and in
the total station, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to connect via LGO.
My plan is to test it again with a serial to usb adapter cable, but I won't
be able to do so for the next couple of weeks.

I would be grateful if someone could send me some sample data that can be
imported into TOPS, by the way, preferably some survey daya with lines and
/ or polygons - I would like to export a dxf from TOPS and see if the line
data comes through.
Stefano, you mentioned a possibility of exporting data from TOPS without
having to use the DXF2SHP converter in Qgis - I would be interested to know
what is done instead.

Many thanks and all the best,

Anna
