Anna, thanks a lot! With this successful installation I give the
existing instructions as working. I will move them from the wiki to the
main documentation site and then release the current TOPS version as
0.3.

This is a big step forward, our first proper release, so let's party! :)

Now to the real stuff:

&gt;<i> My problem is that I still can't get line data off the machine:
</I>&gt;<i> I send the data off the total station (Leica TCR805, works with the
</I>&gt;<i> TCR705 parser) in AutoCAD (dxf) format. Then I save the data as .dxf.
</I>&gt;<i> When I use the dxf2shp converter in Windows I still only get points,
</I>&gt;<i> no lines. 
</I>&gt;<i> What format should I export as / save in, in order to get line data?
</I>&gt;<i> GSI?
</I>
Do I understand correctly that you download the data without problems
(i.e. you can see the transferred data in the text area box)? If so, and
if you're getting a DXF file straight from the total station, make sure
you save it directly and not through the &quot;Process&quot; dialog (that means
using &quot;Save data&quot;). DXF is not good for being processed, by the way. GSI
instead is what we should aim to support (but we don't support it yet).

Maybe my previous e-mails on this topic were confusing, but at the
moment TOPS cannot process line data. This is one of our targets for
0.4. It would be fantastic if you could assist us in developing this new
functionality, both providing us with raw data (in GSI format) and
testing the program.

Ciao,
steko

PS it might be interesting that the SurveyTools plugin for QGIS
<A HREF="http://www.catais.org/qgis/plugins.xml">http://www.catais.org/qgis/plugins.xml</A> by Stefan Ziegler incorporates a
GSI8 parser. Last year Stefan and I discussed general plans for merging
SurveyTools and TOPS in a single codebase (leaving the QGIS plugin
separate from the backend), but we never had the time and energy to do
it. Still, the code is there and could be easily adapted to fit the TOPS
architecture.
