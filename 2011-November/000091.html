<PRE>Hi Steko,

Cool, glad to help! :-)

Yes, on the total station I select &quot;AutoCAD (dxf)&quot; as output format, then I
can see numbers in TOPS, but still get the stopbit issue, as previously
reported, although I use the same settings. Then I do &quot;Save raw data&quot;,
navigate to wherever I want to save it to, and then name the file and give
it the .dxf extension. That one I then process using dxf2shp in QGIS. I
haven't tested the geojson app on Ubuntu yet. I am looking at everything on
Windows because at OA most people use Windows, that's the issue. I will try
it on Ubuntu in a bit, though. I choose DXF as output format because I want
to make sure it's the same coming out of the total station and out of TOPS,
but maybe GSI would be better as total station output.

Yes, the GSI8 parser exists in Survey Tools. I really want  to try it, the
problem is, though, that I always get an error when I select my input GSI,
saying &quot;Keine Stationszeile gefunden&quot; - I think this means that it needs
station information, or maybe a header row in the data table? I'm really
not sure (even as a native german speaker...).

Good to know about the line data - that would be most useful and it might -
right now - be the reason not so many people would be keen to test TOPS
here, as it takes extra processing time. Do you know if the geojson app
deals with it differently?

Many thanks and all the best,

Anna

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have now had a chance to test your methodology of installing TOPS on

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anna, thanks a lot! With this successful installation I give the
</I>&gt;<i> existing instructions as working. I will move them from the wiki to the
</I>&gt;<i> main documentation site and then release the current TOPS version as
</I>&gt;<i> 0.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a big step forward, our first proper release, so let's party! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now to the real stuff:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My problem is that I still can't get line data off the machine:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I send the data off the total station (Leica TCR805, works with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TCR705 parser) in AutoCAD (dxf) format. Then I save the data as .dxf.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I use the dxf2shp converter in Windows I still only get points,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no lines.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What format should I export as / save in, in order to get line data?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GSI?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do I understand correctly that you download the data without problems
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. you can see the transferred data in the text area box)? If so, and
</I>&gt;<i> if you're getting a DXF file straight from the total station, make sure
</I>&gt;<i> you save it directly and not through the &quot;Process&quot; dialog (that means
</I>&gt;<i> using &quot;Save data&quot;). DXF is not good for being processed, by the way. GSI
</I>&gt;<i> instead is what we should aim to support (but we don't support it yet).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe my previous e-mails on this topic were confusing, but at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment TOPS cannot process line data. This is one of our targets for
</I>&gt;<i> 0.4. It would be fantastic if you could assist us in developing this new
</I>&gt;<i> functionality, both providing us with raw data (in GSI format) and
</I>&gt;<i> testing the program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ciao,
</I>&gt;<i> steko
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS it might be interesting that the SurveyTools plugin for QGIS
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.catais.org/qgis/plugins.xml">http://www.catais.org/qgis/plugins.xml</A> by Stefan Ziegler incorporates a
</I>&gt;<i> GSI8 parser. Last year Stefan and I discussed general plans for merging
</I>&gt;<i> SurveyTools and TOPS in a single codebase (leaving the QGIS plugin
</I>&gt;<i> separate from the backend), but we never had the time and energy to do
</I>&gt;<i> it. Still, the code is there and could be easily adapted to fit the TOPS
</I>&gt;<i> architecture.
