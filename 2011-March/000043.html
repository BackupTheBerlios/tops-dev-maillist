Hi Max,

&gt;<i> Ciao Stefano, We're intrested in using your nice Total Open Station
</I>&gt;<i> software, and are wondering if it's supported/usable for any of the
</I>&gt;<i> top selling models on amazon.com, like CST/berger 5-Second Electronic
</I>&gt;<i> Total Station - Model# 56-CST205
</I>
first of all thanks for your interest in Total Open Station. As you
might have guessed from the website, the software is still quite
experimental, in that it has been tested with very few models and
makers. CST/berger is not (yet!) among those, unfortunately. I wasn't
able to find detailed specs on their website, but the main thing to
check is whether it's using some strange proprietary communication
protocol or a standard serial communication. Once the data are
downloaded, there may be thousands of different formats in which they
come, but it's a matter of writing the right software module to extract
it.

&gt;<i> If not, what models/software would you recommend we use? We definitely
</I>&gt;<i> want an open linux platform rather than Windows.
</I>
I should say that I'm no expert in total stations &#8210; TOPS was written
primarily to deal with a single device and afterwards other people asked
us to support more models. It would be good if you could check with
someone who already has one from CST/berger, at least with regard to the
TS-PC connection (Total Open Station can be used as a &quot;dumb&quot; serial
receiving terminal when in &quot;Custom&quot; mode).

Generally speaking, old devices are much simpler in their machinery,
while new ones tend to have &quot;cool&quot; features (e.g. Bluetooth data
transmission) that are more difficult to support in a general purpose,
low-profile application like TOPS.

After all, I think that you could be able to make a good contribution to
Total Open Station by helping with extending support to this new model.

Please let me know if you need more information.

Ciao,
steko
