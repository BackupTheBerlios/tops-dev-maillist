<PRE>Stefano,

You wrote: &quot;great to hear that! I'm also interested to learn where TOPS is
mentioned, just to understand the potential users' needs.&quot;

If I remember correctly, I heard TOPS mentioned on the OSGeo
Discussions mailing list.

You wrote: &quot;We (me and Luca Bianconi) are actively working on it,
right now we're in
the process of rewriting the format parser engine to support more
formats from total station devices.&quot;

I'm glad to hear TOPS is still being developed. Is there a list of the
currently supported total stations? Perhaps I can help implement a
couple of brands/models you don't have access to. I've got Leica and
Topcon models at work.

You wrote: &quot;The repository is open and you can
get the entire source tree with Mercurial.&quot;

I've never used Mercurial. I'm familiar with CSV, SVN, and I'm
starting to learn Git. I'm a little weary about getting another
version control system on my computer. :] Is there a way to download a
zip file of the source code?

You wrote: &quot;As the website says, TOPS is
written in the Python programming language, which isn't perhaps very
akin to AutoLISP, but should be quite easy to read, at least.&quot;

I write code in a little more than AutoLISP. :] Java is my favorite
programing language, and I am fairly hand with it. I am passingly
familiar with Python and just started work on another open source
program in Python. Most of my programming work is on the open source
desktop GIS program OpenJUMP. I only work with AutoLISP so I can
customize the CAD programs I use at work.

You wrote: &quot;I would be happy if you could provide some insights on what such a
software should do, where you see room for improvement and new features
you value as important.&quot;

I should probably get a build of TOPS working on my computer before I
provide to much feedback. I am curious about the overall goals of the
program. Is it simply going to be a tool for moving data from total
stations? Or will it be like a gateway, allowing the user to move data
back and forth?

Will the program do more, like allow for the adjustment of total
station measurements and the automatic generation of linework?

Are you guys using tcl/tk for the program's GUI?

At this point, I'm mostly interested in learning how the program
works. Then I may have some ideas for how I can help.

I appreciate the quick response. I think you guys are doing great work
that is right up my alley. Programs like TOPS could really change the
dynamics of the surveying industry in the long run.

Landon
