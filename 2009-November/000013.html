&gt;<i> I'm glad to hear TOPS is still being developed. Is there a list of the
</I>&gt;<i> currently supported total stations? Perhaps I can help implement a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of brands/models you don't have access to. I've got Leica and
</I>&gt;<i> Topcon models at work.
</I>
There's not such a list (at least an updated one), but you can see the
actual list of models here:
<A HREF="https://hg.berlios.de/repos/tops/file/84d60519421b/models/models.py#l8">https://hg.berlios.de/repos/tops/file/84d60519421b/models/models.py#l8</A>

It would be great if you could implement new models. We usually write a
separated parser for each format. Different models can output the same
format and viceversa a single device can output many formats (not all
models do however). The roadmap is to completely separate formats from
models in the code.

Right now we're in the middle of re-thinking the program internals a
bit, so your input is very valuable.

&gt;<i> I've never used Mercurial. I'm familiar with CSV, SVN, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> starting to learn Git. I'm a little weary about getting another
</I>&gt;<i> version control system on my computer. :] Is there a way to download a
</I>&gt;<i> zip file of the source code?
</I>
<A HREF="https://hg.berlios.de/repos/tops/archive/tip.tar.gz">https://hg.berlios.de/repos/tops/archive/tip.tar.gz</A> the easy way. Once
you've made the move from CVS/SVN to git, hg shouldn't be that hard (btw
this topic would be an interesting one for the interview).

&gt;<i> I write code in a little more than AutoLISP. :] Java is my favorite
</I>&gt;<i> programing language, and I am fairly hand with it. I am passingly
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with Python and just started work on another open source
</I>&gt;<i> program in Python. Most of my programming work is on the open source
</I>&gt;<i> desktop GIS program OpenJUMP. I only work with AutoLISP so I can
</I>&gt;<i> customize the CAD programs I use at work.
</I>
Sorry I have underestimated your skills :) I do like OpenJUMP and have
used it a bit last year. Python was my choice because it's almost the
only programming language I've learnt (by myself). The availability of a
good library for accessing the serial port was a nice extra..

&gt;<i> I should probably get a build of TOPS working on my computer before I
</I>&gt;<i> provide to much feedback. I am curious about the overall goals of the
</I>&gt;<i> program. Is it simply going to be a tool for moving data from total
</I>&gt;<i> stations? Or will it be like a gateway, allowing the user to move data
</I>&gt;<i> back and forth?
</I>
The initial &quot;itch to scratch&quot; was to move over the need for Microsoft
Windows just to download data with a dedicated program. After that came
the beauty of one program &quot;to rule them all&quot; instead of many proprietary
programs, one for each brand/model - often in archaeological units more
than one total station is used and this generates a useless overhead.

Right now it's just a one-way tool from total station to computer. In my
team there's no actual need to move data the opposite way, but I would
say &quot;why not?&quot;.. in the end once we understand the ASCII format used by
a model it's even easier to create data than to read it.

To try it, just download the compressed archive, make sure you have
Python and the two needed libraries (tkinter and pyserial), see
<A HREF="http://tops.berlios.de/docs/requirements.html">http://tops.berlios.de/docs/requirements.html</A> (outdated, but still
valid). On Mac OSX or Linux it's quite easy - Windows requires a bit
longer procedure right now and we're working on a dedicated installer.

&gt;<i> Will the program do more, like allow for the adjustment of total
</I>&gt;<i> station measurements and the automatic generation of linework?
</I>
This is on our TODO list.

&gt;<i> Are you guys using tcl/tk for the program's GUI?
</I>
At the moment, yes. Tcl/Tk comes with Python's standard library and
works out of the box on all platforms (an I mean *all* ... think
OpenMoko). It's not a complete GUI toolkit so we're evaluating more
mature toolkits like GTK+ and Qt, but their adoption would require for
sure a complete rewrite of the program internals.

&gt;<i> At this point, I'm mostly interested in learning how the program
</I>&gt;<i> works. Then I may have some ideas for how I can help.
</I>
Basically the program is split into 3 separate parts that deal with
      * downloading data from total stations (this is just a wrapper
        around pyserial)
      * reading data, extracting coordinate values and attributes for
        points
      * exporting data to useful formats for use in CAD or GIS software
        (current formats: DXF, CSV, SQL for PostGIS or SpatiaLite and a
        dedicated format for a photorectification program)

The GUI exposes these features to users, enabling things like saving raw
data and processing them later. The same is available through a command
line program for nerds like myself.

&gt;<i> I appreciate the quick response. I think you guys are doing great work
</I>&gt;<i> that is right up my alley. Programs like TOPS could really change the
</I>&gt;<i> dynamics of the surveying industry in the long run.
</I>
I'd be glad if such a thing happens some time in the future. As said
before, I'm an archaeologist and Luca Bianconi is a programmer, so we're
not surveying professionals - your help could improve the project a lot.

Best,
steko
