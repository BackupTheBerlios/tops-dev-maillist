Maxim,
great feedback! I've seen this kind of problems before but I never had
the time to debug &#8210; I don't have a Windows machine.

This is 99% due to the fact that opening a serial port is a blocking
operation. The second time you're getting an error because the port is
already blocked by the first invocation of serial.Serial: I'm guessing,
but it looks reasonable.

Apparently this behaviour is only happening on Windows, but if it turns
out to be a a common problem we could try to add a workaround inside
TOPS.

Assigning the serial.Serial to a variable
        
        s = serial.Serial('COM4')

could you try to close the port with

        s.close()

and then calling a second time Serial(), with another variable name:

        t = serial.Serial('COM4')

and see if it gives an error or not? If this works (e.g. you're not
getting the error anymore), we could try to catch the SerialException
when it occurs and closing the port on the fly, like calling

        serial.Serial('COM4').close()

I cannot test this last suggestion, but it would be very helpful if you
could tell us how it goes. We will add a FAQ to the website until there
is a proper fix.

Also, did you try again downloading data from TOPS? Apparently it should
be able to open the port just like it was the &quot;first time&quot; in your
tests.

&gt;<i> I also realized that the baudrate through that command was 9600 so
</I>&gt;<i> tried running the command with baudrate=19200 as an argument which
</I>&gt;<i> returns a similar result, first time works and second time doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> anymore.
</I>
Yes, this shouldn't make a huge difference for these simple tests, but I
see you are making quick progress with the Python interpreter :-)

&gt;<i> On a side note, I have a portable with opensuse installed but don't
</I>&gt;<i> have a 9-pin serial port and not sure where to get a driver for the
</I>&gt;<i> usb to serial cable, plus I haven't even looked into installing TOPS
</I>&gt;<i> in that computer so figured that in windows it seemed a little more

</I>&gt;<i> linux systems, it be nice to have this working with FUMDHAM's
</I>&gt;<i> computers which are mostly running windows..!
</I>
I absolutely agree with you, supporting Windows is one of our top
priorities (even though we mostly use Linux ourselves). Hopefully with
your help we can provide first-time users with a more complete
experience. We have been trying to produce a single, portable executable
for Windows that could be carried also on a USB stick, but we didn't
succeed, so far.

Don't worry about drivers for usb-serial cables: they work
out-of-the-box on Linux (you will get a port like &quot;/dev/ttyUSB0&quot;): this
is one of the advantages over Windows. So, you could install TOPS also
on your OpenSUSE laptop.

Ciao
Stefano
