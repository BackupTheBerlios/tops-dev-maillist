New issue 23: Issues connecting to the serial port on Windows
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/issue/23/issues-connecting-to-the-serial-port-on">https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/issue/23/issues-connecting-to-the-serial-port-on</A>

Stefano Costa / steko on Sun, 12 Jun 2011 18:24:02 +0200:

Description:
  Issues connecting to COM ports under Windows have been reported by some users. This is Windows-specific and it's not directly related to TOPS nor Python, but nevertheless leaves users without a clue on how to download data from their total stations.

First of all, we should write a more detailed documentation to help these users.

Secondly, we should catch the specific exceptions that occur with this kind of problem, and give instructions on workarounds.

Finally, we should investigate if we are able to play with serial ports from within Python to prevent this problem at all.
