Hello Maxim,
welcome! Let's see if we can help you. Apparently the problem is not
with TOPS itself, but with pyserial not being able to open COM4, as you
have already noted.

First of all, you could try one of the solutions proposed here
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6105182/error-while-opening-port-in-python">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6105182/error-while-opening-port-in-python</A>

If nothing works, can I ask you to perform the following to test if this
is a bug, and then we can investigate the problem in depth or go to the
pyserial mailing list and ask for help there.

     1. open a Python terminal (it should be named &quot;IDLE&quot; in the Start
        menu)
     2. the prompt is &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;
     3. try &quot;import serial&quot; at the prompt and ENTER (everything should
        work)
     4. then type &quot;s = serial.Serial('COM4')&quot; and ENTER
     5. &quot;s.open()&quot; and see if the same error comes out as you posted
     6. if it gives you an error, try again but using number instead of
        port name, like &quot;s = serial.Serial(3)&quot; &#8210; (numbers start from 0
        so 3 should be the same as COM4)
     7. see if any error comes out with &quot;s.open()&quot;

I hope this is not too difficult, but I got the impression from your
e-mail that it will be easy for you to test it this way. Let us know
what are your results.

&gt;<i> On a short note working for the archeological NGO FUMDHAM in Piau&#237;,
</I>&gt;<i> Brazil and we are trying out open source software alternatives for our
</I>&gt;<i> cartography and topography sections. 
</I>
This is great news! Can I suggest you to get in touch with OSGeo Brasil
<A HREF="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Brasil">http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Brasil</A> if you didn't already? They will help
you a lot with everything related to cartography and geographical
software.

We are really glad to hear that TOPS is used for an archaeological NGO!
We are archaeologists ourselves, and we are working since many years
with open source software, TOPS is our small contribution to the
collective effort!

Ciao,
Stefano
