<PRE>Hi all,
in the past few months we have been working towards a 0.2 release for
Total Open Station. At this point, things are in a good shape.

New features include:
      * added support for raw polar formats like Nikon RAW and Topcon
        GTS
      * saving of the last choices used in the GUI (i.e. port and model)
      * refactoring of the models code, now the parsing of data is
        completely separated from the download

What's missing? Basically, Windows support. We did some tests on
Windows, and our idea was that having a single-file executable was the
most desirable option - e.g. Total Open Station could run even from a
USB stick this way. However, there were some problems with both
pyInstaller and py2exe, we're still trying to figure them out. In the
meantime, if there's anyone who is willing to contribute, please step
ahead. All our development process is open as are our development tools
(both pyInstaller and py2exe are free software).

All things considered, it's likely that a release candidate for 0.2 will
come out in the next few weeks, with a final release at the end of June.

Ciao,
steko
