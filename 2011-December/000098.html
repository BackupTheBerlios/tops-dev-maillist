<PRE>Dear Total Open Station users and developers,
despite the recent announcement of BerliOS being rescued by a
Germany-based association
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=37533">http://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=37533</A> months ago I
had already started moving the main TOPS website to a iosa.it subdomain
(which we own and control), following the first announcement that
BerliOS would be discontinued. I was not alone in this move: if you look
at <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/news/">http://developer.berlios.de/news/</A> you will see that many projects
chose to move to SourceForge or other source code hosting facilities as
a result of this first announcement.

The new website is therefore

	<A HREF="http://tops.iosa.it/">http://tops.iosa.it/</A>

(it's even easier to type and spell, see).

At this point our infrastructure is so organised:

     1. website: iosa.it
     2. mailing list: berlios.de
     3. source code repository: bitbucket.org
     4. issue tracking: bitbucket.org

The weakness is in #2 and #4, because they are not easily moved. I was
exploring alternatives for mailing list (focusing on librelist.com) when
the announcement for renewed interest in BerliOS was made. The most
obvious question to this problem is: why don't you move to Google
Groups? The answer is that I don't like it for Total Open Station,
simple as that.

While most of the above stuff will be irrelevant to you, I think it's
important to share with our growing community the concerns we have to
keep the project in good health.

0.3 marks a milestone in the development of Total Open Station. In a few
days, I will send a short summary of what we intend to do for 0.4, with
a shorter release cycle (that would mean releasing 0.4 in March) open
for discussion and comments.

Ciao,
steko


</PRE>
