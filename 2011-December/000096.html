<PRE>Total Open Station 0.3 was released today!

What is Total Open Station anyway?
Total Open Station (TOPS for friends) is a free software program for
downloading and processing data from total station devices.

This is a task which is usually done by proprietary, dedicated and
Windows&#8482;-only software, but TOPS is different by nature, because:

      * it is free software released under the GNU GPLv3 license;
      * it works on any operating system, including mobile platforms
        like OpenMoko;
      * it is designed to support as many devices and formats as
        possible, all within the same program, opposed to having one
        program per device.

Total Open Station is available as a source install for GNU/Linux and
other UNIX systems (possibly including Mac OSX, feedback welcome), and
as a binary installer for Microsoft Windows. Downloads and install
instructions at <A HREF="http://tops.iosa.it/installing.html">http://tops.iosa.it/installing.html</A>

Release 0.3 is our first official release, and already has support for
different input formats (there are lots of them out there). More formats
will be supported in next releases, and user feedback is essential.

Total Open Station is developed within the IOSA Project, and is written
in Python. Our website and documentation is at <A HREF="http://tops.iosa.it/">http://tops.iosa.it/</A> if
you want to find out how to contribute or read more detailed
documentation.

Ciao,
Stefano
